    <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
    <ul>
        <li>3 each skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tsp minced garlic</li>
        <li>2 cans of spaghetti sauce, divided</li>
        <li>2 containers part-skim ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of grated parmesan cheese, divided</li>
        <li>1 tsp of Italian seasoning, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p><h2>Directions</h2></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil over medium-high heat and add chicken breasts; reduce heat and let simmer until chicken falls apart easily with a fork and is no longer pink, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain water, shred chicken with 2 forks, and set aside.</li>
        <li>While chicken is boiling, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and lay noodles in a single, flat layer on a paper towel to dry.</li>
        <li>Heat butter in a small saute pan over medium-high heat. Saute onion and garlic in the hot butter just until onion is translucent, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix shredded chicken, onion-garlic mixture, 1 cup spaghetti sauce, ricotta cheese, 1/2 of the Parmesan cheese, and Italian seasoning together in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Mix remaining spaghetti sauce and remaining Parmesan cheese together in another bowl. Spread a thin layer on the bottom of a glass 9x13-inch baking dish. Layer 3 lasagna noodles, spread chicken mixture on top, then add another thin layer of the sauce mixture. Repeat, leaving a final layer of noodles on top. Top with remaining sauce. Sprinkle mozzarella and Cheddar cheese on top.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until heated through and cheese bubbles, about 45 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Good job! You've made a lasagna, now keep it safe and watch out for lasagna bandits</p>
